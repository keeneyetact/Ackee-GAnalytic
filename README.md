## Introduction

### What is Ackee?

Ackee is a web app you install on your server to analyse the traffic of your sites.

### Why Ackee?

Ackee is lightweight, easy to install and has a good balance between analytics and privacy. It features a GraphQL API and web interface and tracks only what's necessary.

It's is the right tool for you if you care about privacy and don't need a full-features marketing analytics platform like Google Analytics or Matomo.

### Benefits of Ackee?

- Self-hosted
- Lightweight and easy to install
- Modern and fast architecture
- Beautiful and focused interface
- No unique user tracking and no cookies
- Fully documented GraphQL API

### How does it work?

You run the Ackee server which then waits for requests through its API.

The API of Ackee accepts information about your visitors sent to it using [ackee-tracker](https://github.com/electerious/ackee-tracker). It's a small script you add to your sites, similar to the JavaScript tracking snippet provided by Google Analytics.

The interface of Ackee lets you view and analyse your tracked information.
